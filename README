# 🧠 Python Algorithm Practice

This repository contains a collection of Python algorithm exercises focused on problem-solving, logic development, and technical interview prep. These scripts were completed as part of my hands-on training at Careerist and are written using clean, readable Python.

---

## 🚀 Topics Covered

- Recursion
- Sorting algorithms
- Array manipulation
- String operations
- Basic search algorithms
- Runtime complexity analysis (big-O thinking)

---

## 📁 File Structure

Each `.py` file represents a self-contained problem with a working solution. Examples include:

- `fizzbuzz.py` – classic divisibility loop
- `factorial_recursive.py` – recursion basics
- `reverse_string.py` – multiple approaches to reverse strings
- `two_sum.py` – hash map-based approach to find target pairs

---

## 🛠 How to Run

All scripts are written in standard Python 3 and can be executed individually:

```bash
python3 filename.py
